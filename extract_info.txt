Information on Extracted Features
=================================

The dataset UCI_HAR created by run_analysis.R extracts the mean and standard deviation measurements from the full features list for both the test and training datasets. These features are merged together to create a single tidy dataset that contains observations on subject / activity pairs for both the training and test datasets. In addition to a "subject_code" and an "activity code"", human readable "activity_label" is added. This dataset also has a "source_id"" column which denotes whether the observation came from the test or training dataset. The variables in this data are shown below with source, units and data transformations as given in the file features_info.txt.
