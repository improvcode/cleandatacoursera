Information on Summary Data
=================================

The dataset UCI_HAR_AVG created by run_analysis.R contains averages calculated for each subject / activity pair. Averages are calculated for each variable described in extract_info.txt, which is a subset of the variables described in features_info.txt. Each row in this dataset corresponds to a unique subject / activity pair. These are denoted by subject_code, activity_code, activity_label. The variables that follow are ALL averages over the subject / activity pair for the given variable. The variable names are inherited from the raw data described in extract_info.txt.
